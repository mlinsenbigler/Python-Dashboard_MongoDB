**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is made possible by following the coding best standards and practices such as proper indenting, formatting, and utilizing remarks properly. Specifically from the CRUD module, creating a modular code set was important and also creating methods that utilize variable calls for values ensures the code will function even if the inputs change. The CRUD module could be used to interface with various types of MongoDB datasets in the future because of its flexible code structure.


**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**


As acomputer scientist I approach a problem by breaking it down into sections. First, trying to get an overall approach to how the problem can be solved. Then laying out the components that will be needed to reach that goal. Finally, diving into the code and iterating through each module until the program is functional and complete. One additional aspect that had to be considered in this project was that it had to interface with an existing database so the request structure had to be created in compliance with the database.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists leverage the power of algorithms and computer processing in order to solve problems. This matters because it can result in faster and more efficient ways of doing work and solving problems. It can also result in new ways of doing things because machines can present new ways of performing tasks that humans haven't thought of before. Work on a project like this could help companies track their data better to see patterns that can help them work more efficiently now and make guided decisions in the future.
